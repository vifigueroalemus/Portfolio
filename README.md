# Schamberger-Rowe Case Study. Data Analytics Project
This repository consists of my data analytics project for Schamberger-Rowe, a business analytics and data visualization work with Excel and Power BI.
This repository has the following files: the original Excel Workbook source file; the finished version of said Excel workbook; and the 'Executive Summary' of the most important insights of the project, shown through data visualization with Excel and a bit of help from Power BI. Finally, it includes 2 Markdown files (in spanish and english) with the complete description, explanation and analysis of my project, presented as articles.
